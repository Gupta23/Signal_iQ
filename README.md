Signal_iQ
=============================

Signal iQ is an SDK that allows for variety of "signals" (events, alerts, SLA violations, Ux events, etc.) to be sent as a signal to SIOS iQ Machine Learning platform for correlation.
Signals will be correlated to the incidents (created via Topological Behaviour Analysis) and summarized into problems (via MetaAnalysis) as well as presented to the users via SIOS iQ UI and APIs.

Such signals are implemented in variety of programming and scripting languages (such as python, C++, C#, javascript, etc.).
